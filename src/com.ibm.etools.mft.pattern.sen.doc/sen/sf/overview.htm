<h1 class="topictitle1"><span></span>Service Facade pattern</h1>
<div><p class="shortdesc">Use a Service Facade pattern to provide loose coupling between a 
service requester and functionality that is provided by an application or 
capability that is not service-enabled. 
The loose coupling conceals the complexities of the provider and presents a standard web service interface.</p>
A Service Facade pattern also introduces a mediation point for the application of standard functions 
such as logging.</div>
<div class="image"><img src="facade.gif" alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the pattern. Applications send service requests to the broker, which fulfills these requests by using functionality which does not provide a service interface." />
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The context</h2>
<p>When an enterprise
architecture moves towards a service-oriented architecture, it is often
necessary to accommodate existing legacy systems that run large parts
of the business, but that do not have a service capability. These
applications often use functions that must be accessible to
newer service-enabled software packages, but that offer access only through adapters, messaging, or other
non-service-oriented integration techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The problem</h2></div>
<p>Legacy applications
do not fit naturally into a service-oriented architecture (SOA) environment and changes to such systems
are expensive and require scarce skills. The problem is to find a way of
integrating such systems with newer service-oriented packages and
applications. In particular, it is necessary to create a bridge between
the synchronous HTTP protocol that is generally used with web services, 
and the messaging protocols that are often used by legacy applications.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Selection guidance</h2></div>
<p>This pattern is
appropriate when an enterprise wants to present a service interface to
requesting clients as part of an SOA environment, but provider
applications cannot easily be upgraded to provide service interfaces.</p>
<p>This pattern is used where provider applications provide an XML interface and client
applications support calls to web services. The pattern can be extended
with transforms to support a service facade to applications with non-XML
interfaces over WebSphere MQ.</p>
