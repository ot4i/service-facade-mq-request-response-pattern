<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the
<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span> pattern</h1>
<div>	
<p class="shortdesc">A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
	<p>
	You can use the 
	<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span>
	pattern only if you meet all of the following constraints:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Requests are received as SOAP messages over HTTP that uses document literal style.
		</li>
		<li>
			SOAP requests and responses use CCSID 1208.
		</li>
		<li>
			Requesting applications can support the 
			<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span> pattern.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provider applications assume responsibility for acting on an update when a 
			message is delivered to its input queue.
		</li>
		<li>
			WSDLs that define the broker interface have only one port type and one binding.
		</li>
		<li>
			WSDLs must contain the definitions that define the properties for the SOAPInput node in the
			definitions of the top level WSDL. Therefore, some complex nested WSDLs cannot automatically
			be processed by the pattern.
			<p>If WSDLs that do not meet this constraint are used, the pattern does not configure the SOAPInput 
			node, but lists configuration of the SOAPInput node as a task to complete after generation of the pattern instance.</p> 
			
		</li>
		<li>
			The provider application supports WebSphere MQ XML messages in a format that can be 
			used as the body of a SOAP request, or you can 
			customize the Request Processing subflow to transform the format to non-XML messages.
		</li>
		<li>
			The pattern defines its own format for the logging and error messages; it is 
			assumed that these messages are sufficient to meet the requirements in your own 
			environment.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can deploy and run the application that is generated from the pattern instance to an integration node that has a queue manager.
			To check whether your integration node has a queue manager, in the Integration Nodes view, select the integration node in the Properties 
			view and check that the <b>Queue manager specified on the integration node</b> field is not blank. If the Properties view is not visible, 
			click <b>Window > Show Properties</b>. To specify a queue manager for an integration node, in the Integration Nodes view, right-click the 
			target integration node and click <b>Change</b>, then enter the required queue manager name.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Some of the preceding constraints, particularly the CCSID, can be overcome by the 
	configuration after the pattern has been applied.
