<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete before applying the <span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
	<div class="section">
		<p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, you must determine
which of the following tasks are required. If required, complete the following tasks:</p>
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Check that this pattern meets your business requirements and can be supported 
			by both the requester and provider applications.
		</li>
		<li>
			Select a unique name for the pattern instance. You can use the pattern multiple 
			times and create multiple different instances, which can be distinguished by 
			their names. Identify the purpose of the pattern instance so that you can decide 
			on an appropriate or meaningful name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Define, or identify the provider interface and associated service interface. 
			Create deployable WSDL in a message set project.
		</li>
		<li>
			Identify queues and queue managers. Existing queue managers and queues can be 
			used, for example, to access the provider application, and their names must be 
			decided. Identify any additional queue managers and queues that are required for this 
			pattern and decide upon their names. Take into account any policies, 
			standards, or naming conventions that must apply.
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Decide whether you require logging of request messages. If logging is 
			required, you must decide to which queue manager and queue the logging 
			messages are sent. You can send logging messages to a general log queue that is used by 
			multiple message flows, or you can use a queue specifically for the pattern 
			instance.
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide if you want to produce error messages for the pattern instance. In 
			this pattern, error messages are for notification of errors on processing, not for 
			preserving data. You can send error messages to a general error queue that is 
			used by multiple message flows, or you can use a queue specifically for the 
			pattern instance. If you choose to send error messages in the pattern instance, 
			you can turn this function on or off by configuring the broker archive (BAR) file 
			before deployment.
		</li>
	</ul>
